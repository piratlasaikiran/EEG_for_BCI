<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7260182">Deep learning EEG response representation for brain computer interface</a>
<p>This repository contains code to run experiments which closely simulate those run by Liu Jingwei et al. in the paper linked to above.</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<h3>Instructions to run:</h3>
<p>It is assumed that you have Conda pre-installed.<br>
    Open up the terminal and type:<br>
    
    git clone https://github.com/piratlasaikiran/EEG_for_BCI<br>
    cd EEG_for_BCI/CNN models
    jupyter notebook
    
 Open up multi_scale_CNN.ipynb, shallow_CNN.ipynb and single_scale_CNN.ipynb to run the respective versions of the implementation.</p>
