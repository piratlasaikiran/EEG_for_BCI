[Deep learning EEG response representation for brain computer interface](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7260182)

This repository contains code to run experiments which closely simulate those run by Liu Jingwei et al. in the paper linked to above.

The EEG data used in these series of experiments is from [Project BCI - EEG motor activity data set](insert link), Brain Computer Interface research at NUST Pakistan.

*The results of the project can be interactively viewed at :*

## Instructions to run:
It is assumed that you have Conda pre-installed.

Open up the terminal and type:

    
    git clone https://github.com/piratlasaikiran/EEG_for_BCI
    cd EEG_for_BCI/CNN models
    jupyter notebook
    
    
Open up `multi-scale CNN.ipynb`, `shallow CNN.ipynb` and `single-scale CNN.ipynb` to run the respective versions of the implementation.
