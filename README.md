# EEG for BCI
[Deep learning EEG response representation for brain computer interface](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7260182)

This repository contains code to run experiments which closely simulate those run by Liu Jingwei et al. in the paper linked to above.

### Algorithm

### Conclusions

### Instructions to run:
It is assumed that you have Conda pre-installed.

Open up the terminal and type:

    
    git clone https://github.com/piratlasaikiran/EEG_for_BCI
    cd EEG_for_BCI/CNN models
    jupyter notebook
    
    
Open up multi-scale CNN.ipynb, shallow CNN.ipynb and single-scale CNN.ipynb to run the respective versions of the implementation.
